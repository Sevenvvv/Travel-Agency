                               Travel Agency
                               -------------

    This code is a personal project of a web site for a travel agencyy. The 
    idea was to familiarize myself with the HTML & CSS languages and also 
    to the web development.
    As the moment, there is only the main page. I will see later if I feel
    like improving it :)
    
    I choose to share it on GitHub to keep an example for my future projects
    but also for the people starting with HTML/CSS. So do not hesitate to use
    it as example.
    
            ==> Have a nice trip :)



    1- HTML FILE : index.html

    This file permit to define the whole structure of the website. It also
    permit to link the CSS file "style.css".
    N.B: Click on this HTML file to launch the website on your web browser.
    
    The file is mainly composed of 3 parts:
        - The head
        - The body
        - The footer 



    2- CSS FILE : style.css

    This file gives the style of the website, otherwise it will be a little
    bit rustic if not sad.
